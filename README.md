# EurOmnis Object Class Example

Library shows how to sub-class external objects and override and call external methods. It further demonstrates how one can implement custom notation properties, use $sendall for sending messages to class instances and how one can use tasks to encapsulate and manage class instances for specific jobs, i.e. editing a plain text or rich text document.

This library is used at EurOmnis in conjunction with the Inside Notation sessions and requires Studio version 8.1.x or better.

To test all features, this library further requires the OWrite external component by Brainy Data. If you do not have it, a demo version is available at https://www.brainydata.com/demos. The OWrite external should be installed prior to importing the library from JSON.
